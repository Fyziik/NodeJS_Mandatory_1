Make everything database related, so that sessions are a table, and a session has a connection with topics, topics have notes etc.

Everything would be connected to this database, which would mean sidebar, topics etc. would be dynamically loaded from this database

Also this database would make it possible to insert via a form, so it'd be possible to easily add new sessions, topics, etc.
