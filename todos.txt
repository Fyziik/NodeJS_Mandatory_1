Make everything database related, so that sessions are a table, and a session has a connection with topics, topics have notes etc.

Everything would be connected to this database, which would mean sidebar, topics etc. would be dynamically loaded from this database

Also this database would make it possible to insert via a form, so it'd be possible to easily add new sessions, topics, etc.





MongoDB collection for a page should contain:
- Title (This is the session number at top and the name in the sidebar)
- Text field (This is the text on each page, should be able to insert html tags)

MongoDB collection for login should contain:
- username
- password




Bonus session can contain:
- EJS
- How to serve static files
- MongoDB
- Python integration



Sessions just in case:

          <h2>What is Node.js</h2>
          <p>
            Before talking about Node.js, we have to talk about Javascript. 
            Javascript is a programming language used for front-end / client-side computing, 
            but some people thought it would be nice if you could separate the workload, so that client-side and 
            server-side could work side by side, instead of only the client-side. Therefore Node.js was created, 
            making it possible to run Javascript in a stand-alone machine. Therefore Node.js is a Runtime Environment, 
            not a programming language or a framework in itself. Together with an HTTP module, 
            it makes it possible to connect this server-side processing with the front-end. 
            This is bounded with the Express framework (and an endless amount of other frameworks via NPM) 
            we can easily create applications as needed.

              if we hit /users with a HTTP GET, we’d expect to retrieve a list of users. 
              Or if we hit /users/id with a HTTP DELETE, we’d expect to be able to delete a specific user by an id.</p>

SESSION THREE

<div class="sessionContent">
          <h2>Theory about variables (var vs let & const)</h2>
          <p>
            Var outdated because it caused errors since it was a variable that had global access, 
            so major programs and having vars would result in major errors. Therefore we now use let & const. 
            Let is mutable and can be changed throughout its lifespan, but a const is immutable, and can not be changed once assigned.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="sessionContent">
          <h2>Type Coercion</h2>
          <p>
            When programming in Javascript, you have to know the difference between == and ===.
            When using double == we’re comparing the values of whatever is on the sides of the equal signs. 
            For instance, when comparing the string “5” and the number 5 i.e: <br>
            <img src="/imgs/TypeCoercion1.PNG" alt="" class="centerImage"> <br>
            This will evaluate to true, because the actual value inside each is 5, 
            but in programs it's risky to have this kind of loose evaluation, therefore we’d like to 
            compare both to value AND to the data type, so we make sure that they’re actually the same. 
            Therefore we use triple equal signs “===” to both compare by value & data type. <br>
            <img src="/imgs/TypeCoercion2.PNG" alt="" class="centerImage"> <br>
            Now this will evaluate to false, even though we didn't change anything BUT add another equal sign. 
            Using triple equals sign is the right way to program with Javascript, since both the programmer 
            and the computer should be able to tell data types apart, and using === makes sure 
            both you and the computer do exactly that.

        <div class="sessionContent">
          <h2>NPM (Node Package Manager)</h2>
          <p>
            NPM er hvad Node.js anvender som package manager, og bruges til at hente og installere dependencies 
            til pakker man godt vil anvende i ens kode. Såsom når vi indtaster <em>“npm install express”</em> i terminalen, 
            dermed henter NPM de nødvendige filer indenfor Express frameworket som vi har behov for, for at 
            kunne anvende Express i vores projekt.

          <h2>Nodemon</h2>
          <p>
            Nodemon is a build tool we install, and makes it automatic to shutdown and setup the listening server, 
            so that we don't have to do it ourselves. Nodemon is activated in the terminal by typing <em>"nodemon [file]"</em>

          <h2>Functional Loops</h2>
          <p>
            <img src="/imgs/FunctionalLoops.PNG" alt=""> <br>
            In this example we use the .map() method, where we console log each element inside the map. 
            So it’s sort of a minimized for each loop. 
          </p>

            <img src="/imgs/URLExample.PNG" alt="" class="centerImage">
            This GET method will for instance be able to tell specifics about the URL, 
            even though our URL can be completely randomized (sorta). :id and :title tells us 
            that we should expect any value at these parts of the URL, though these values should make 
            sense in a context of what's beforehand in the URL. For instance if we’re hitting the 
            endpoint /users/:id we would expect id to be a number, or if the endpoint was /users/:name 
            we should expect a string, because the scenario is (most likely) a search in the users via a name

        <div class="sessionContent">
          <h2>Receiving data in Express</h2>
          <p>
            With the Express framework we can fast and efficiently create methods in our app.js file 
            for receiving various POST calls, these are written, for instance
            <img src="/imgs/ExpressDataReceiving.PNG" alt="" class="centerImage">
            Here we are ready to receive data at endpoint /whatever, where we expect to receive some sort of 
            data packed into the req variable of the method. In this case we just respond with the JSON object, as a JSON object. <br>
            <img src="/imgs/ExpressPostmanExample.PNG" alt="" id="postmanExample"> <br>
            Here we send the POST call through Postman (since we don't have a form for our site)
            <ol>
              <li>First we click “Body”.</li>
              <li>Then we click “raw”.</li>
              <li>Then change the format to JSON.</li>
              <li>Next we write our JSON object, the keys have to be within quotation marks.</li>
              <li>Click send.</li>
              <li>Lastly we can see the response from the server, which in our case was the object we sent to the server in the first case.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </div>



    SESSION FIVE

    <div class="sessionContent">
          <h2>How to serve .html files</h2>
          <p>
            Html files are always stored inside a folder called ‘public’ when working with Node.js. 
            Therefore we create a folder called ‘public’ inside of the root folder. In this public folder we create .html files 
            for various paths and serving. After this is done, we can make a path inside our app.js file 
            for serving the necessary .html file, in this case the welcome.html file.
            <img src="/imgs/serveHtml.PNG" alt="" class="centerImage">
            Visual Studio Code can also create a HTML boilerplate for us, just make a new .html file 
            and type html, then select html 5, and thus we have a boilerplate.
